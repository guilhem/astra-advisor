# Astra Advisor

**GPT-6 Astra plans the work, chooses useful bounded delegation dynamically, and
owns verification and acceptance.**

Astra Advisor is a Codex plugin for capability-routed software delivery. Give Astra
the goal, constraints, and repository context; it decides whether independent work
should run alongside the parent session and chooses a supported native subagent
model and effort for each bounded deliverable.

## Cloud limitation

ChatGPT Work cloud `create_thread` must omit `model` and
`thinking`, so it cannot currently promise arbitrary model or effort control. Astra
does not dispatch a model-pinned request there by default. Native Codex subagents are usable
where the current tool schema exposes the needed controls.

## Quick start

Install the plugin in a current Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app with plugins
enabled. Start a fresh task after installation and select GPT-6 Astra at any effort
supported by the current Codex host:

~~~sh
codex plugin marketplace add DannyMac180/astra-advisor --ref main
codex plugin add astra-advisor@astra-advisor
~~~

Start a task with:

~~~text
Use $astra-advisor:orchestration to plan, build, verify, and review this work.

## How routing works

Astra remains the architect and acceptance owner in the primary GPT-6 Astra session
at the effort selected by the user. After capability preflight, Astra records the
parent model and effort as observed or unobservable before implementation or
delegation begins. The skill never changes the parent session.

When delegation helps, Astra uses the exposed generic `collaboration.spawn_agent`
tool. Substantial reviews prefer `fork_turns: "all"` to retain the discussed needs,
constraints, and tradeoffs. Full forks inherit the parent model and effort, so both
overrides are omitted. Narrowly targeted checks may use reduced context when enough.
Other bounded delegates receive an explicit `model`, `reasoning_effort`, and
`fork_turns: "none"`. For explicit selection, Astra chooses
among `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` from the task's risk,
context, and independent work. There are no predefined role TOMLs, companion
installer, role-to-model mapping, or fixed subagent count cap. Astra gives each
subagent a concrete bounded deliverable and continues useful parent work while it
runs.

Live tool metadata is authoritative. The current documented effort snapshot is:

| Model | Known efforts |
| --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |

If a selected model, effort, control, or tool is unavailable, conflicting, or
unobservable, Astra fails that delegation closed and reports the limitation. It does
not silently substitute a model, effort, role, or fabricated tool. Chosen values and
runtime-confirmed values are reported separately.

For an initial substantial implementation, Astra inspects the complete diff and runs
the requested checks, then requests an independent read-only review of that stable
artifact. A short assignment identifies the diff, accepted scope, and evidence.
The reviewer verifies conclusions against the code and distinguishes requirements
from assumptions. Blocking findings must demonstrate an in-scope defect; `ship` may
include P3 and non-blocking P2 residual risks.

Astra accepts the work only after `ship`. After `fix-first`, it batches blocking
corrections, runs affected checks, and obtains targeted confirmation, preferably
from the same reviewer, preserving unaffected evidence. A new full review is needed
when design, authority, ownership, or material risk changes. `rethink` requires a
revised plan. Small documentation and mechanical changes need parent inspection.

## Live visibility and cost receipts (0.2.0)

Every delegation announces its name, bounded task, selected model and reasoning
effort, and selection reason. Its result reports actual status and runtime-observed
settings, or explicitly says those settings are unobservable. These updates also
cover reviewers and targeted follow-ups. A requested setting is not proof of the
realized setting.

Every task ends with an API-equivalent cost receipt. When native tools expose token
usage, the receipt estimates its USD price using the versioned snapshot and compares
that same token workload repriced entirely at Astra. It separates whole-task,
delegated-only, and partial coverage. Missing parent or reviewer usage prevents a
whole-task claim. Without observed usage, the receipt says why it is unavailable.

The difference is a **same-token API price comparison**. It does not measure what an
all-Astra run would actually consume, actual net task savings, quality, speed, or a
change to ChatGPT subscription charges or usage credits. No subagents means no
delegation savings. Reasoning effort does not multiply the token price.

The [pricing snapshot](plugins/astra-advisor/pricing/2026-09-04.json) records official
source URLs and standard short-context USD rates per million tokens, verified by
the recording coordinator on September 4, 2026. These are historical estimates;
Sol pricing is promotional and may change. The calculator rejects unsupported
long-context, service-tier, and cache-write cases instead of assuming standard rates.
It conservatively supports at most 128,000 input tokens per call; this is an
implementation support boundary, not a claimed official pricing threshold.

Try the clearly labeled illustrative workload (not a receipt for your task):

~~~sh
python3 plugins/astra-advisor/scripts/cost_receipt.py plugins/astra-advisor/examples/illustrative-usage.json
sh plugins/astra-advisor/scripts/verify.sh
~~~

The calculator emits JSON and accepts `--pricing PATH` for another verified snapshot.
Its input lists agents and unique atomic calls, usage provenance, coverage assertions,
and explicit pricing eligibility. It validates cached-input and reasoning-output
subsets, refuses overlapping aggregates, and keeps unknown usage separate from zero.
See the [operations reference](plugins/astra-advisor/skills/orchestration/references/operations.md)
for the input contract and receipt policy.

## ChatGPT app tasks

Separate app tasks require an explicit user request. For an explicit Codex app task,
`mcp__codex_app__create_thread` supports `model` and `thinking`; call
`mcp__codex_app__list_projects` first for project targets, use a worktree by default
for Git projects, and use local otherwise. Cloud `create_thread` omits both controls,
so the bounded limitation above applies. Do not use an API key, nested CLI, or
invented tool as a workaround.
